# Openpose-setup

This is just a .ipynb code file to setup open pose completely without any issue/error


Follow the steps one by one it run smothly

Downloading all the data properly then only you will able to create build files and configure files

Once you will put all the model files in the main model folder it will run in next time without any issue.

Models link file : https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose/issues/1602

I will write each any every thing in the colab file.

Thanks in advance
